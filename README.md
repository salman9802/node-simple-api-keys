# Simple API with key management in Node Express

This is an API built in Nodejs Express that demonstrates managing api-keys, access to them and limits calls per day. No databases are used, all users are stored in-memory.

**Note**: This is my first ever github repository, so expect it to not look good.


## Features

- User registration with only username.
- API key validations.
- User can add/remove ips allowed to use api key.
- No databases required. Users stored in memory.
